                            Unveiling Growth Patterns: Data Analysis and Prediction for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</a></h2>
                    <p>The analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station data has become increasingly vital due to rising electricity demand, reduced reliance on crude oil, and lower carbon emissions. This study collected EV charging station data from 2011 to 2020, focusing on transaction fees, charging levels, and methods of ending charging sessions. Furthermore, it utilized data visualization techniques to depict charging time, energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, and gasoline savings annually. A decrease in energy consumption is noted in 2020 due to covid-19. Additionally, the SKTime algorithm is employed to forecast these attributes from 2021 to 2026, revealing significant growth in the average charging time, energy consumption, GHG emission reductions and gasoline savings. Also the forecast shows the total energy consumption by all charging stations.<br />The analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station data spanning from 2011 to 2020 has provided valuable insights into the transformative impact of EV technology on energy consumption, environmental sustainability, and transportation trends. The findings highlight the increasing importance of EV charging infrastructure as a key enabler for reducing reliance on crude oil, mitigating carbon emissions, and meeting growing electricity demands. The observed dip in energy consumption in 2020, attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on travel patterns, serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness between societal events and energy usage trends. Furthermore, the use of the SK Time algorithm for predictive modeling has revealed optimistic projections for the years 2021 to 2026, indicating substantial growth in energy consumption and significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These results underscore the urgency and potential of EV adoption in shaping a more sustainable and efficient transportation ecosystem. Continued investment in EV charging infrastructure, data analysis, and predictive modeling tools will be crucial for guiding policy decisions, optimizing resource allocation, and accelerating the transition towards a cleaner and greener transportation sector.<br />
